## James

I woke up.  
One Monday morning  
And i didn t know what to do.  
And in my head was something yawning  
And it was yawning about you  
Bring me to James St. James infirmary  
Where i can help my friend  
Bring me to James St. James infirmary  
Where i can help my beautiful friend  
And when I got to the station, and I had no patience,  
I don t ride away  
I don t like to hesitate  
So bring me to James, please don t let me wait again  
Cause I wanna help my friend so bad.  
Bring me to James St. James infirmary  
Where i can help my friend  
And i will never let him go ohoh  
And i lent him my hand, yes I do.  
  
Bring me to James, don t let me wait again.
