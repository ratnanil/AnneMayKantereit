## Don't You Say a Word

Don't you say a word  
And make me hurt myself  
Don't you say a word  
I believe there ain't no--  
There ain't no way to say  
What you did today  
  
Don't you say a word  
Don't you say a word  
I believe there ain't no pain  
If you go there and go down in Spain  
I believe there ain't no way to say  
  
Ah, don't you say a word  
Ah, don't you say a word  
  
Ah, don't you say a word  
  
  
  
  
Yesterday, my love will(?) smear over the rain  
And now the moon came to ease my pain  
  
Don't you say a word, ah  
Don't you say a word  
Don't you say a word  
Don't you say a word  
  
Don't you say a word  
Don't you say a word  
Ah, don't you say a word  
If I said it hurts  
I want you in silence  
'Cause you cause no violence  
Don't you say a word  
Don't you say a word  
Don't you say a word  
Don't you say a word
