## Leavin

You're miles away  
Taking a train  
Would have asked you to stay  
But all my words are in vain  
  
So if you're leavin'  
Why don't you leave me?  
Why do you stay on my mind?  
If you're leavin'  
Why don't you leave me alone?  
  
Time went too fast  
Day seems so long  
I'm sitting all alone  
Wondering why you're gone  
  
  
  
  
And if you're leavin'  
Why don't you leave me?  
Why do you stay on my mind?  
If you're leavin'  
Why don't you leave me alone?  
  
You're miles away, taking a train  
I would have asked you to stay  
But all my words are in vain  
You're miles away  
Time went too fast  
Day seems so long  
Sitting all alone  
Wondering why you're gone  
  
And if you're leavin'  
Why don't you leave me?  
Why do you stay on my mind?  
If you're leavin'  
Why don't you leave me alone?  
  
And if you're leavin'  
Why don't you leave me?  
Why do you stay on my mind?  
If you're leavin'  
Why don't you leave me alone?
