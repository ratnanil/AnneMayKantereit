## Come Together

Here come old flat top,  
He come grooving up slowly,  
He got joo joo eyeball,  
He one holy roller  
He got hair down to his knees  
Got to be a joker, he just do what you please  
  
He wore no shoe shine,  
He got toe jam football,  
He got monkey finger,  
He shoot Coca-Cola,  
He say "I know you, you know me"  
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free  
  
Come together, right now,  
Over me!  
  
  
  
  
He bag production,  
He got walrus gumboot,  
He got Ono sideboard,  
He one spinal cracker,  
He got feet down below his knee,  
Hold you in his armchair, you can feel his disease  
  
Come together, right now,  
Over me!  
  
He roller coaster,  
He got early warning,  
He got muddy water,  
He one mojo filter.  
He say "one and one and one is three"  
Got to be good looking cause he's so hard to see  
  
Come together, right now,  
Over me!
